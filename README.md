# Developers
My first experimental project

I'm learning djano to be a full experienced developer.This project is what I have learned following a nice django course.
This project consists of two apps which are Projects and Users. The first one allows user exhibit their projects.
The second one oversee the users information, credential and actions.
Authentication, creating a databse, donig CRUD on it, sending message to users and some other nice stuffs are included into this project.
If you want to run it with Dockerfile make sure that you're uncommented sqlite3 database configuration and reversly comment PostgreSQL database confuguration inside settings.py
